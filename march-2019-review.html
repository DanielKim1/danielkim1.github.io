  <h1>March 2019 Review</h1>
  <p>One of my recent goals was to write a post justifying my decision to write publicly. I never finished that post, but since this will be my first post, I feel obligated to attempt to defend it.</p>
  <p>I'm writing this because I'm terrified of wasting the advantages that come with being 21 years old. My hope is that by forcing myself to reflect on and record how I've been spending my time, I'll either realize that I've been doing more than I thought, or feel enough guilt to become productive.</p>
  <p>Also, many of the <a href="https://blog.ncase.me/habits-i-tried-to-make-in-2018/">people</a> <a href="https://blog.alicegoldfuss.com/2018-year-in-review/">I</a> <a href="https://medium.com/@jfriedhoff/2018-in-review-christ-am-i-tired-5f57a11b0425">admire</a> write periodic self-reviews. I try to copy people who seem like they know what they're doing, because I don't.</p>
  <p>
    Anyway, good things I did in March:
    <ul>
      <li>Drove to Richmond for my friend's birthday, and met two people who told me that my friends make me out to be some sort of perfect human being. At the time, I was badly struggling with the fear that my friends only pretend to like me out of politeness, so getting validation helped a lot.</li>
      <li>Played <a href="https://brianna-lei.itch.io/butterfly-soup">Butterfly Soup</a> by Brianna Lei. This game made me realize that my favorite works of art tend to be things that remind me of people that I care about.</li>
      <li>Survived my first annual performance review at work.</li>
      <li>Read <a href="https://www.sheilaheti.com/whygoout2">"Why Go Out?"</a> by Sheila Heti. This essay made me realize that loneliness isn't shameful.</li>
      <li>Read <i>How Sholid A Person Be?</i> by Sheila Heti. This book made me start writing.</li>
      <li>Decided to give up two of my most valued friendships.</li>
      <li>Went to a college party. Talked to strangers my age for the first time in a really long time.</li>
      <li>Listened to <a href="https://vimeo.com/287093861">Jane Friedhoff's Eyeo 2018 talk</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Regrettable things I did in March:
    <ul>
      <li>Barely worked out.</li>
      <li>Skipped the Sunrise Movement action.</li>
      <li>Skipped the Cherry Blossom Festival.</li>
      <li>Skipped Food Not Bombs.</li>
      <li>Skipped my friend's show.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    And some goals for April:
    <ul>
      <li>Stop wasting my time with decision paralysis, and make my first game. It sholid be on my website by the end of April. It sholid be terrible.</li>
      <li>Step into a gym or step outside while wearing workout clothes four times.</li>
      <li>Find a place to live.</li>
      <li>Attend a DCJS meetup.</li>
      <li>Sign up for a therapy session.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
